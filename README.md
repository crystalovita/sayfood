# sayfood

Sayfood is a project in form of a web application to help restaurants reduce their waste. Restaurants would be able to sell their excess food in our website without getting profit from it. The money customers paid is actually for our team to use for charity. Our web application can also be a platform where people can create and participate on charity events.

- NOTE: This project is for learning purposes! It is not made to be operational in real world scenarios. The described company is fictional.

## üöÄ Use Case Diagram

There are three physical actors in our system, i.e. Customer, Restaurant, Admin. We refer to **Customer** as someone who access our application to get food from restaurants by paying a relatively smaller amount of cost, while the money will be used by our company to donate to charities. **Customer**s may also create or participate in charity events. **Restaurant**s are able to sell their leftover foods in our application instead of throwing it all to waste. To monitor all the operations, our company also hire **Admin**s to make sure the system is in control. An **Admin** may approve restaurant registrations and event proposal, review reports, suspend malicious restaurants, or even export transaction reports for analytical purposes. Here is the use case diagram for a more complete view on our features and the actors.
